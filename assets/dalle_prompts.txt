Design a set of flat, minimalistic, vector-style icons at 80Ã—80 pixels for a flight overlay application. Create three variations for each icon representing different operational statuses: one for 'active' (using a vivid green color), one for 'in permit' (using yellow), and one for 'inactive' (using muted gray). The icons should represent six aerodrome types:

Aerodrome (standard airport icon),

Heliport (a helicopter landing pad icon),

Heliport (Boat) (a helicopter icon with a boat element),

Heliport Platform (an icon depicting a helicopter platform),

Seaplane Base (an icon that symbolizes water and a seaplane), and

Takeoff Zone (an icon that represents a hot air balloon).

Ensure that each icon variant is clear, modern, and easily identifiable, with a consistent look that fits within a flight overlay map similar to ForeFlight
